# Mindy

An attempt to make a Mindustry 4.0 style RTS game. 

  additional goals are
  
    use as few lines of code possible while being clearly legible. 
    
    implement shaders for parallel tasks wherever it makes sense
    
    make a 3D engine to play on

    being a meme
    
    networking with no desyncs
